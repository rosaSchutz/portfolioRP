#### My process

- Built with:
- HTML5
- Javascript
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox


#### Continued development

I learned the difference between "hover" and "focus," and I also remembered how to make a button round. When trying to retrieve a value from a list of nodes, I discovered that "event.target.textContent" is necessary. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of NodeLists thanks to an error message ("The error "buttonScore is not a function" is occurring because you're trying to use buttonScore as a function to add a click event listener to the buttons. However, buttonScore is actually a NodeList, which is a collection of DOM nodes. To fix this error, you need to loop over the NodeList and add the click event listener to each button individually.").
