#### My process

- Built with:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

#### Continued development

I've been using TailwindCSS a bit, and I'm still working on some things. One of the things I need to improve is how I set the font family. I can't seem to get the bold style to apply to the title. I'm not sure if it's something about the typography I'm using.
